# workdayPlanner
This Workday Planner is designed for users who work a 9-5 schedule who want to
log their "need-to-do" tasks in the time logs that run from 9 am all the way
to the end of the day, being 5 pm.

The Workday Planner informs the user of the date and shows the time with the seconds decreasing per second.
below is a text area where the user can input their tasks and once the lock "save" button is clicked, their task will
be saved in local storage with the specific time in which they wrote their task. 
Also, the text area can be expanded depending on how much they have to write in the text input box.

The color blocks change depending on the time. I put informative color blocks for the user to know what the significance 
of each color means. Former Events being gray, Current Events being green, and Upcoming Events being yellow.
